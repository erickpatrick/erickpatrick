# Hey!

Thanks for checking my profile here =)

I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of experience in web systems and development.

In the last 10 or so years, I've been focusing on in the highly scalable aspect of eCommerce systems. Now, I'm learning new skills around Elixir and Phoenix, as well as in Mobile Development for iOS. 

I'm also interested in: 
- Software architecture,
- video games (specially Zelda, Metroid, Pokémon, and Diablo),
- RPGs (Cairn, Tales from the Loop, The One Ring, Mork Borg, etc), and
- card games (Pokémon and Magic).
